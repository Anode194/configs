# configs

this repository has all my configs for my various systems. as well as lists of commonly used programs that may or may not have dotfiles saved here in case I need to remember what they are.

* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
* [joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

### linux specific utilities:
[BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
    - window manager sometimes confusing but crazy powerful and light on system resources 
[sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
    - hotkey daemon mostly used with BSP to manipulate windows. the config file is a bash script so very easy to configure.
[picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)
    - lightweight compositor for perdying up my system a little.
[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
    - status bar. I don't use this to its full potential It mostly justs give me the time and whether i'm connected to the internet.
[rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
    - app launcher window switcher. another program that I only use its basic functionality. right now I think i'm using a config that it comes with out of the box.
