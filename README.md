# configs

this repository has all my configs for my various systems. as well as lists of commonly used programs that may or may not have dotfiles saved here in case I need to remember what they are.

### mac utilities: 

* [hummingbird:](https://github.com/finestructure/Hummingbird)
    - allows for easily moving and resizing windows in mac, works flawlessly. written in swift
* [markoff:](https://github.com/kaishin/Markoff)
    - markoff is a markdown viewer it's not perfect but it's written in swift and it's nice and simple.

### shared utilities:
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

* [joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
    - notetaking app and todo app. since I split my time between multiple systems and OS's I do 100% of my writing in this app. can't reccomend it enough. written in js. 
### linux utilities:
